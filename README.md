# Website

## Welcome... you've found my website... 

There's really nothing to it. It's just a website where I will have some more css as I finish a web development course and I'll be putting some links to code there. Also, I've started learning javascript so I might make some cool web-apps.

I think I'll be putting some quick code snippets written in python to do simple, everyday tasks.

I hope you enjoy!
